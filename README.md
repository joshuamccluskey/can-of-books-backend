From fantasy fiction to thought provking scripts, these ideas and words shaped the way we think. With this app, you should get a reading list from each of us.

## Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  Garunteed working hours after lunch until 6:00 PM PST
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  Slack, Remo, Gmail
- How often will you take breaks?
  10 minutes on the hour.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  One person identifies it to the other and start pair programming. Find time to work on it outside of set lab hours. Ask TA then ask Ryan.

## Cooperative

- Make a list of each person’s strengths.
  - Shane:
    - Write out process before coding
    - Strong understanding of React and states and props
    - Strong understanding of routing and APIs
  
  - Josh:
    - Maintianing Git flow and GitHub workflows
    - Strong undrstanding of React and states and props
    - Data management and flows
  
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - Leverage each other strengths as needed.
  - It's more important to work on your weaknesses than strengths during pair programming.
  - If someone has a strength take navigator role and the other takes the driver
  
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Shane:
    - Learning more in areas of less exposure
    - Experimenting more in React Bootstrap

  - Josh:
    - Strengthing retrieveing backend data and routing
    - Troubleshooting diconnects between APIs and the Frontend
  
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - We'll be pair programming for most of the coding, and we will be sharing the load and touchign every aspect of it.
  - If somone volunteers to work on their development area more, then have that person work in that area. If they run into trouble then transition into pair programming. Give them the room to learn and grow if they want to work in that area.

## Confilct Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Each of us the right to contact Ryan if the other is not pulling their weight. Then have discussion amongst the 3 of us.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - Voice your concerns to Ryan if you don't feel comfortable vocing it to your partner. Then have a discussion amongst the 3 of us.
  
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Being honest with yourself and knowing your weakness and know what the other stregnths are. If we are reaching a deadline just do our best to get it done on time.

## Git Flow GitHub

- Before merging to main talk to the other to make sure there are no conflicting issues. At the end of the lab, merge our changes into main and have each other look over before the merge.
- Name each branch example `lab11.1` then new branch during lab `lab11.2` or for the next lab `lab12.1`
